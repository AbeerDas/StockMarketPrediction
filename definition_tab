Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

Like MSE, a perfect model would have an MAE of 0.
Lower MAE values are better.
MAE is easier to interpret than MSE as it is in the same unit as the target variable.
R-squared (R2):

R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
R2 ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
A higher R2 value (closer to 1) is desirable, but the interpretation can vary. For example:
0.86 is generally considered a good R2 score, indicating that 86% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model.
An R2 of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable.
It's important to note that the assessment of "good" or "bad" scores can be problem-specific. In some domains, achieving an R2 of 0.86 might be excellent, while in others, it might be considered moderate. Additionally, consider the scale and characteristics of your target variable when interpreting MSE and MAE.

In summary, your reported scores (MSE: 0.00, MAE: 0.04, R2: 0.86) look quite good, especially the low MSE and MAE values, and the relatively high R2 score. However, the interpretation ultimately depends on the nature of your prediction task and the specific requirements of your application.
